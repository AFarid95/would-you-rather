# Would You Rather...?

**Would You Rather...?** is a web application that lets you play the “Would You Rather?“ game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [*option A*] or [*option B*]?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

Using the application, you can:

- Post questions for others to answer
- Toggle between answered and unanswered questions
- Answer questions (be careful, you can only answer each question once!)
- See the number of votes for each option on each question you have answered
- See the ranking of all users on the leaderboard (to rank higher, you have to ask and answer more questions)
